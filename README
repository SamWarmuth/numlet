Eventually will give solid multi-lingual support for turning arabic numerals into words

Examples:

55.to_cardinal
  => 'fifty-five'

55.to_cardinal(:lang => 'es')
  => 'cincuenta y cinco'
  
10.to_ordinal
  => 'tenth'
  
10.to_ordinal(:lang => 'es')
  => 'd√©cimo'
  
To add a new language:

  1. Fork.
  2. Add text files to /cardinals and /ordinals that provide examples for relevant inflection points.
      Use the form "numeral, words \n" (see existing files)
  3. Add tests for your language that fail; commit.
  4. Implement language in source so that tests pass.
  5. Send me a pull request.
